# Back to Coding

This repository is dedicated to **refreshing and improving my JavaScript and MERN stack development skills** after a break. It contains structured exercises, day-by-day practice, and mini-projects to reinforce concepts in:

- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, scope, operators)
- Node.js and Express (backend APIs, RESTful services)
- MongoDB (CRUD operations, Mongoose integration)
- React (frontend development)
- Authentication and deployment
- Full MERN stack projects

## Structure

- Week1: JavaScript refresher exercises
- Week2: Node.js + Express backend exercises
- Week3: MongoDB + Mongoose integration
- Week4: React frontend exercises
- Week5: Authentication + deployment
- Week6: Final MERN project(s)

Each exercise is placed in **separate files** with **commits documenting progress** to maintain a clean Git history and track daily learning.

This repo also serves as a **portfolio-friendly showcase** of coding consistency and problem-solving approach.
